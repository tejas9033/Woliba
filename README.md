# Woliba - Wellness Onboarding Platform

Woliba is a lightweight, passwordless onboarding system built with Laravel. It's designed to help organizations streamline the process of inviting employees to register and explore their personal wellness interests and well-being pillars, removing the friction of traditional password-based logins.

This project was developed with a focus on clean architecture, efficient workflows, and robust security using an OTP-based authentication system.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Admin-Driven Invitations**  
  Admins can easily generate and send secure, and token based links to employees.

- **Passwordless Login**  
  Employees access the platform directly via their unique invite link, eliminating the need to create and remember a password.

- **OTP Verification Flow**  
  A multi-step security process requires users to verify their identity with a One-Time Password (OTP) sent via email before they can proceed with registration.

- **Wellness Interest Capture**  
  The onboarding process is simple and intuitive, allowing users to select and save their wellness preferences and well-being pillars.

- **Secure Registration**  
  After successful OTP verification, users complete their profile, and their information is securely registered in the system.
